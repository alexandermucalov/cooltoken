						<p class="text-justify text-secondary small">This application requires that users have a <a href="https://metamask.io/"><b>MetaMask</b></a> account, which is used to connect to the Ethereum Mainnet. So if you don't have a MetaMask account already, go ahead and get one, then hop on back. Otherwise this is all there'll be for you on this page.<br><br>

						If you've got a MetaMask account and you're still reading this, you may need to log in, and/or add this domain to the list of sites allowed to read from your account. Open MetaMask, click into your settings, click connections, then add this site. And it's worth double-checking that your account is currently reading from the "Main Ethereum Network."<br><br>

						You'll also want a tiny bit of ETH to pay the gas on transactions, and also some <a href="https://makerdao.com/en/"><b>DAI</b></a> to exchange for the tokens found on this site. DAI is an Ethereum-based "stablecoin" that trades 1-for-1 with U.S. dollars, and you can get it on any major crypto exchange, such as <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/"><b>Coinbase</b></a>. Accepting DAI instead of ETH in exchange for the tokens here helps you avoid the risk of loss through ETH price fluctuations.<br><br>

						If you're all set up with MetaMask, some ETH, and some DAI, thanks for your patience here. This application is completely decentralized, which makes it take longer to load. All of the code behind what you see is publicly available, and none of your information is captured or stored on any proprietary server. Right now, the site is fetching your MetaMask credentials, connecting to the Ethereum Mainnet, and reading and/or writing from/to the underlying smart contracts. Browser-based Mainnet queries can take a while, but the page should eventually load.<br><br>

						The good thing is that you're on the Internet; so if you get bored reading this, you can always open another tab and Google something, or go to Twitter and search your favorite hashtag. Or if you have your phone on you, check out Instagram or whatever. Goodness knows there's no shortage of ways to distract yourself on the web these days. Heck, read the news, even, if you have the stomach for it. Real life certainly seems stranger than fiction right now.<br><br>

						I mean, have you seen the movie 'Contagion'? A knockoff of it was Top 10 in the U.S. on Netflix just a short while back (I think the knockoff was called 'Outbreak'?). Back in 2011, 'Contagion' was a cautionary tale of a dystopian future where humanity was unprepared for a deadly virus that ends up plowing through defenseless peoples around the globe ... except in 'Contagion,' the virus wasn't expected to come back every couple months with the vengeance of a taunted bull, and the vaccine came quickly and without incident.<br><br>

						But you're not here to wallow in the dread that swirls around us all these days, like a suffocating miasmic fog. You're here because you're interested in becoming personally invested in mitigating global warming (the next global catastrophe many years in the making). Or, if we're being honest, maybe you're here just to make a buck or two playing the hot new crypto game that all your friends are playing. But whatever the draw, investing in the tokens you'll find on this site (symbol: "COOL") should let you both pocket a decent return and also root for a healthier, more sustainable planet ... which is kinda the whole point of this service.<br><br>

						Let's face it: many of us, yours truly included, pay way too much attention to things that don't deserve it - like that outrageous status update on your "friend's" Facebook newsfeed this morning, or yesterday's US Weekly article on Meghan Markle's favorite ice cream flavor. Some people I know can name all of the Kardashians (sp?) for God's sake - or even the Jenners (it's amazing how so many can explain the overlap and the difference).<br><br>

						But some things do merit the attention they get. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoUEQYjYgf4"><b>Gangster cat videos</b></a> are always worth it. Or take business news: lots of coverage goes to the breakthroughs, crashes, marriages, and divorces of leading companies ... and this is maybe mostly deserved. After all, the world's leading firms engineer life-saving treatments for deadly viruses, deliver to our doorsteps gizmos and widgets of all kinds at the tap of a digit, and even find ways for humanity to eventually colonize the moon, Mars, and beyond.<br><br>

						Riddle you this, though: what about the bajillion other companies whose doings impress far less than their pathfinding peers - why do they daily make the 'Financial' section in the New York Times? I mean, people clearly must care, because that's prime real estate!<br><br>

						The answer's gotta be that enough readers hold these companies' shares, and want to stay tuned to the balances in their 401(k)'s. Following and forecasting a stock's price can mean the difference between adding "stepping foot on Angkor Wat" or "Machu Picchu" to our bucket lists ... or not.<br><br>

						And because so many are so invested, entire industries have sprung up to meet shareholders' demand that firms keep working for them, and to distinguish the good projects from the ugly. Accountancies and auditors apply and enforce common reporting rules, like GAAP and IFRS, pitting firms and their chiefs in head-to-head contests on the common basis of profit. Hedge funds, private equity firms, and newfangled so-called 'quantitative finance' shops spend - in the case of the latter at least - every bitwise nanosecond determining what distinguishes winners from losers. And all these stats and analyses make it fun and easy to talk stocks - as if they were collectible Mickey Mantle baseball cards, with RBIs marked down to the 9th inning, digestible and dissectible by fans all over.<br><br>

						So while I actually know nothing about baseball (which is perhaps obvious from that last sentence), the point is this: we pay attention when we're invested. Secondary and supportive enterprise blossoms from the seeds of those investments under the sunlight of our scrutiny, and day-to-day discourse pollinates yet more and better ways to help investments flourish.<br><br>

						So, what if we could take this harmonious ecosystem rooted in firms' pursuit of private profits, and deliberately plant something similar, but rooted instead in humanity's shared pursuit of public outcomes? What if we could invest not only in private companies, but also in the health of our planet? Cool Tokens intend to make this possible.<br><br>

						And hey, if Cool Tokens work - if they get even a couple more people to know and do more to keep our planet cooler and healthier - then perhaps we can make other tokens to get us invested in other global issues (think "world hunger" or "peace on Earth," but without the eyeball-rolling and jaded cynicism). The potential to align individual incentives with the global good may be limited only by the availability and trust in the data measuring the world outcomes that matter most.<br><br>

						... But for now, yikes, this really has gotten off-topic, hasn't it. You can explore these <a href=""><b>quixotic notions</b></a> further, if you'd like. But before it comes to that, I really hope this page loads, for your sake and mine. Because frankly, this is becoming embarrassing.
